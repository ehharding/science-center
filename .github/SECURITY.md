## Reporting a Bug In a Third Party Module

Security bugs in third party modules should be reported to their respective maintainers.

## Disclosure Policy

Here is the security disclosure policy for the Science Center:

- The security report is received and is assigned a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
  process. The problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find any
  potential similar problems. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still under maintenance. These fixes are not
  committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.

- A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEÂ®)) is
  requested for the vulnerability.

- On the embargo date, the Science Center security mailing list is sent a copy of the announcement. The changes are
  pushed to the public repository and new builds are deployed to science-center. Within six hours of the mailing list
  being notified, a copy of the advisory will be published on the Science Center blog.

- Typically the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time the CVE is issued. However, this may vary depending on
  the severity of the bug or difficulty in applying a fix.

- This process can take some time. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible;
  However, it's important that we follow the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a
  consistent manner.
