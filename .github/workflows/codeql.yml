# This Workflow automates the CodeQL analysis process for the project. It is triggered by:
# - Push events to the 'main' branch
# - Pull Requests targeting the 'main' branch
# - Scheduled events (every Monday at midnight)
#
# The Workflow consists of a single job that runs on an Ubuntu environment. Key steps include:
# - Securing the runner environment
# - Setting up the repository
# - Initializing CodeQL for specified languages (JavaScript and TypeScript)
# - Performing an automated build
# - Running the CodeQL analysis
#
# Permissions:
# - Read permissions for contents and actions
# - Write permissions for security events
#
# Matrix strategy is used to run the analysis on multiple languages.
#
# Variables and reusable configurations are set using outputs and environment variables for efficiency and consistency.
